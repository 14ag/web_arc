# Calculator Website Project

Welcome to the Calculator Website Project! This project aims to generate a webpage from a JavaScript file. So, let's embark on this journey together!

## Project Overview

In this project, I'm not going to generate a webpage from a JavaScript file.
**That will be the second iteration**  because I have much to learn.

## To-Do List

### Add Pizzazz:
- Use hand-drawn elements to give the website a unique and personal touch.
- Make math things float around to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- Play the math lady meme in the background to add a fun and lighthearted element.
- On error, use the confused Nick Young meme to provide a humorous touch.

### Add History:
- Implement a history feature using the dataset to keep track of previous calculations.

### Use JavaScript Classes:
- Utilize JavaScript classes to organize and structure the code efficiently.
